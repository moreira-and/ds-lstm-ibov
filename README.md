# time-series-prediction-rnn

## Aboult

This project implements a robust time series forecasting pipeline to predict the closing prices of the IBOVESPA index, Brazil’s main stock market benchmark. It combines advanced data preprocessing techniques using scikit-learn with a deep learning architecture that integrates convolutional layers (Conv1D), recurrent layers (LSTM and GRU), and dense layers. The model incorporates regularization (L2) and dropout to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the training experiments and results are systematically tracked using MLflow to ensure reproducibility and facilitate hyperparameter tuning.

### Project flow

Open the notebook [0.0-amp-main.ipynb](/notebooks/0.0-amp-main.ipynb) and run all cells.

### Key features include:
- Data normalization and inverse transformation with scikit-learn for effective model training and interpretability.
- A hybrid neural network architecture designed for sequential financial data.
- Use of MLflow for experiment tracking and model management.
- Modular codebase enabling experimentation with training parameters and architectures.

### Technical Highlights:
- Modular architecture with strategy and template patterns for easy extensibility and maintenance.
- Reproducible ML pipelines orchestrated and tracked with MLflow.
- Decoupled configuration using .yaml files.
- Integration with notebooks and dashboards for data exploration and results presentation.
- Clear separation of concerns between ingestion, transformation, modeling, and visualization.
